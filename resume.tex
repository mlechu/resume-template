  \SubsectionAndLocation{Arby's}{Canada \ • \ Remote}
  \DetailAndDate{Software developer intern}{May 2021 – Present ($\rightarrow$ Dec 2021)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Joked with the past intern over Slack about the questionable \cm{JavaScript} and \cm{TypeScript} code they wrote
    \item While upgrading the app through multiple major versions of \cm{Angular}, managed to bring CPU usage to 100\% for extended periods of time (caused by the antivirus scanner going insane). Luckily, due to remote work, I did not have to deal with the machine's noise or heat.
    \item Enjoyed 3+ poké salads from the \cm{Elasticsearch} webinars that offered UberEats vouchers
    \item Woke at 4:30–5:30 each morning in time for 6AM standups in my time zone; went out to enjoy the early sunrise while it lasted.
  \end{itemize}

  \SubsectionAndLocation{UBC Department of Computer Science}{Vancouver, BC \ • \ Remote}
  \DetailAndDate{Leetcode teaching assistant}{Jan 2021 – Jun 2021}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Taught dozens of students why not to pass a massive 2D array as an argument "by value" in \cm{C++}
    \item Navigated past thousands of (identical) stack frames in \cm{GDB} caused by incorrect base case detection
    \item Remained nameless on the course Discord until the end of the term, when I linked students to my LaTeX resume template
  \end{itemize}

  \DetailAndDate{Course scheduler designed to "save me time" lol}{Aug 2020 – Present}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Started this project knowing nothing; picked \cm{Node.js}, \cm{React}, and \cm{MongoDB} mostly because that's what some freecodecamp tutorial used
    \item Discovered the cons of introducing dependencies such as \cm{Bootstrap}—on my own time, reinventing the wheel is just a learning exercise
    \item Due to the exponential-time algorithm, currently working on notifying the user if the input is too large. Solving the halting problem???
    \item Received 4+ "wow nice" and 2+ "cool can you make it for my school" comments
  \end{itemize}

  \DetailAndDate{Robot interrogation simulator}{May 2021}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Came up with a surprisingly usable project name in 30 seconds, marking a 300\%+ reduction from past hackathons
    \item Wrangled the AI into producing relevant questions using \cm{Javascript} and some convoluted pipeline; laughed at many incorrect outputs
    \item Worked within the constraints of the \cm{Google Cloud Natural Language} and \cm{OpenAI GPT-3} free API dollars
    \item Scripted, recorded, and uploaded a demo video starring stock photos in the final 30 minutes of the hackathon
  \end{itemize}

  \DetailAndDate{Probably unpaid labour, but it's ok it was fun}{Mar 2021}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Dragged two friends into their first hackathon, hopefully helping them learn \cm{Python} and \cm{Flask}
    \item Won a category by default—all the other teams gave up on this category or something
  \end{itemize}

  \SubsectionAndLocation{Summit Leadership Case Competition}{Vancouver, BC}
  \DetailAndDate{Team leader—"The Education Application"}{Jan 2018 – Jun 2018}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bombarded mentors with university questions that would usually be answered by an older sibling if I had one
    \item Still curious about which UBC room we presented in for the semifinals, despite actually attending UBC now
    \item Sat in office chairs possibly worth more than anything I owned
